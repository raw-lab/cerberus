## About

Cerberus transforms raw sequencing (i.e. genomic, transcriptomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomic) data into knowledge. It is a start to finish python code for versatile analysis of the Functional Ontology Assignments for Metagenomes (FOAM), KEGG, CAZy/dbCAN, VOG, pVOG, PHROG, COG, and a variety of other databases including user customized databases via Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for functional annotation for complete metabolic analysis across the tree of life (i.e., bacteria, archaea, phage, viruses, eukaryotes, and whole ecosystems). Cerberus also provides automatic differential statistics using DESeq2/EdgeR, pathway enrichments with GAGE, and pathway visualization with Pathview R.

## Installing Cerberus

### Option 1) Mamba

- Mamba install from bioconda with all dependencies:

#### Linux/OSX-64

1. Install mamba using conda

```bash
conda install mamba
```

- NOTE: Make sure you install mamba in your base conda environment unless you have OSX with ARM architecture (M1/M2 Macs). Follow the OSX-ARM instructions below if you have a Mac with ARM architecture.

2. Install Cerberus with mamba

```bash
mamba create -n cerberus -c conda-forge -c bioconda cerberus
conda activate cerberus
cerberus.py --setup
cerberus.py --download
```

#### OSX-ARM (M1/M2)

1. Set up conda environment
```bash
conda create -y -n cerberus
conda activate cerberus
conda config --env --set subdir osx-64
```
2. Install mamba, python, and pydantic inside the environment
```bash
conda install -y -c conda-forge mamba python=3.10 "pydantic<2"
```
3. Install Cerberus with mamba
```bash
mamba install -y -c conda-forge -c bioconda cerberus
cerberus.py --setup
cerberus.py --download
```

- NOTE: Mamba is the fastest installer. Anaconda or miniconda can be slow. Also, install mamba from conda not from pip. The pip mamba doesn't work for install. 

### Option 2) Anaconda - Linux/OSX-64 Only

- Anaconda install from bioconda with all dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n cerberus -c conda-forge -c bioconda cerberus -y
conda activate cerberus
cerberus.py --setup
cerberus.py --download

```

### Option 3) Manual with conda/mamba from Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raw-lab/cerberus.git 
cd cerberus
bash install_cerberus.sh
conda activate Cerberus
cerberus.py --download
```

## Brief Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raw-lab/cerberus/main/img/workflow.jpg" alt="Cerberus Workflow" height=600>
</p>

### Cerberus has three basic modes: quality control (QC) for raw reads, formatting/gene prediction, and annotation. 
- Cerberus can use three different input files: 1) raw read data from any sequencing platform (Illumina, PacBio, or Oxford Nanopore), 2) assembled contigs, as MAGs, vMAGs, isolate genomes, or a collection of contigs, 3) amino acid fasta (.faa), previously called pORFs.
- We offer customization, including running all databases together, individually or specifying select databases. For example, if a user wants to run prokaryotic or eukaryotic-specific KOfams, or an individual database alone such as dbCAN, both are easily customized within Cerberus.
- In QC mode, raw reads are quality controlled via FastQC prior and post trim [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC). Raw reads are then trimmed via data type; if the data is Illumina or PacBio, [fastp](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560)  is called, otherwise it assumes the data is Oxford Nanopore then Porechop is utilized [PoreChop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop).
- If Illumina reads are utilized, an optional bbmap step to remove the phiX174 genome is available or user provided contaminate genome. Phage phiX174 is a common contaminant within the Illumina platform as their library spike-in control. We highly recommend this removal if viral analysis is conducted, as it would provide false positives to ssDNA microviruses within a sample.
- We include a --skip_decon option to skip the filtration of phiX174, which may remove common k-mers that are shared in ssDNA phages.
- In the formatting and gene prediction stage, contigs and genomes are checked for N repeats. These N repeats are removed by default.
- We impute contig/genome statistics (e.g., N50, N90, max contig) via our custom module [Metaome Stats](https://github.com/raw-lab/metaome_stats).
- Contigs can be converted to pORFs using [Prodigal](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/prodigal), [FragGeneScanRs](https://github.com/unipept/FragGeneScanRs/), and [Prodigal-gv](https://github.com/apcamargo/prodigal-gv)) as specified by user preference.
- Scaffold annotation is not recommended due to N's providing ambiguous annotation.
- Both Prodigal and FragGeneScanRs can be used via our --super option, and we recommend using FragGeneScanRs for samples rich in eukaryotes.
- FragGeneScanRs found more ORFs and KOs than Prodigal for a stimulated eukaryote rich metagenome. HMMER searches against the above databases via user specified bitscore and e-values or our minimum defaults (i.e., bitscore = 25, e-value = 1 x 10<sup>-9</sup> ).

## Input formats

- From any NextGen sequencing technology (from Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore)
- type 1 raw reads (.fastq format)
- type 2 nucleotide fasta (.fasta, .fa, .fna, .ffn format), assembled raw reads into contigs
- type 3 protein fasta (.faa format), assembled contigs which genes are converted to amino acid sequence

## Output Files

- If an output directory is given, that folder will be created where all files are stored.
- If no output directory is specified, the 'results_cerberus' subfolder will be created in the current directory.
- Gage/Pathview R analysis provided as separate scripts within R.  

## Visualization of Outputs

- We use Plotly to visualize the data
- Once the program is executed the html reports with the visuals will be saved to the last step of the pipeline.
- The HTML files require plotly.js to be present. One has been provided in the package and is saved to the report folder.

## Annotation Rules

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raw-lab/cerberus/main/img/Rules.jpg" alt="Cerberus Rules" height=600>
</p>

- ***Rule 1*** is for finding high quality matches across databases. It is a score pre-filtering module for pORFs thresholds: which states that each pORF match to an HMM is recorded by default or a user-selected cut-off (i.e.,  e-value/bit scores) per database independently, or across all default databases (e.g, finding best hit), or per user specification of the selected database.
- ***Rule 2*** is to avoid missing genes encoding proteins with dual domains that are not overlapping. It is imputed for non-overlapping dual domain module pORF threshold: if two HMM hits are non-overlapping from the same database, both are counted as long as they are within the default or user selected score (i.e., e-value/bit scores).
- ***Rule 3*** is to ensure overlapping dual domains are not missed. This is the dual independent overlapping domain module for convergent binary domain pORFs. If two domains within a pORF are overlapping <10 amino acids (e.g, COG1 and COG4) then both domains are counted and reported due to the dual domain issue within a single pORF. If a function hits multiple pathways within an accession, both are counted, in pathway roll-up, as many proteins function in multiple pathways.
- ***Rule 4*** is the equal match counter to avoid missing high quality matches within the same protein. This is an independent accession module for a single pORF: if both hits within the same database have equal values for both e-value and bit score but are different accessions from the same database (e.g., KO1 and KO3) then both are reported.
- ***Rule 5*** is the ‘winner take all’ match rule for providing the best match. It is computed as the winner takes all module for overlapping pORFs: if two HMM hits are overlapping (>10 amino acids) from the same database the lowest resulting e-value and highest bit score wins.
- ***Rule 6*** is to avoid partial or fractional hits being counted. This ensures that only whole discrete integer counting (e.g., 0, 1, 2 to n) are computed and that partial or fractional counting is excluded.

- NOTE: The KEGG database contains KOs related to Human disease. It is possible that these will show up in the results, even when analyzing microbes. eggNOG and FunGene database are coming soon. If you want a custom HMM build please let us know by email or leaving an issue.

### Custom Database

To run a custom database, you need a HMM containing the protein family of interest and a metadata sheet describing the HMM required for look-up tables and downstream analysis. For the metadata information you need an ID that matches the HMM and a function or hierarchy. See example below. 

#### Example Metadata sheet
| ID | Function |
| ---- | --- |
| HMM1 | Sugarase | 
| HMM2 | Coffease |

After processing the HMM files Cerberus calculates a KO (KEGG Orthology) counts table from KEGG/FOAM for processing through GAGE and PathView.
GAGE is recommended for pathway enrichment followed by PathView for visualize the metabolic pathways. A "class" file is required through the --class option to run this analysis. 
As we are unsure which comparisons you want to make thus you have to make a class.tsv so the code will know the comparisons you want to make. 

#### For example (class.tsv):
| Sample  |   Class      |
| ------- | -------------|
| 1A      | rhizobium    |
| 1B      | non-rhizobium|

The output is saved under the step_10-visualizeData/combined/pathview folder. Also, at least 4 samples need to be used for this type of analysis.  
  
GAGE and PathView also require internet access to be able to download information from a database. Cerberus will save a bash script 'run_pathview.sh' in the step_10-visualizeData/combined/pathview directory along with the KO Counts tsv files and the class file for running manualy in case Cerberus was run on a cluster without access to the internet.

### Multiprocessing / Multi-Computing with RAY

Cerberus uses Ray for distributed processing. This is compatible with both multiprocessing on a single node (computer) or multiple nodes in a cluster.  
Cerberus has been tested on a cluster using Slurm <https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm>.  
  
A script has been included to facilitate running Cerberus on Slurm. To use Cerberus on a Slurm cluster, setup your slurm script and run it using sbatch.  

```bash
sbatch example_script.sh
```

example script:  

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#SBATCH --job-name=test-job
#SBATCH --nodes=3
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --mem=128MB
#SBATCH -e slurm-%j.err
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL,REQUEUE

echo "====================================================="
echo "Start Time  : $(date)"
echo "Submit Dir  : $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR"
echo "Job ID/Name : $SLURM_JOBID / $SLURM_JOB_NAME"
echo "Node List   : $SLURM_JOB_NODELIST"
echo "Num Tasks   : $SLURM_NTASKS total [$SLURM_NNODES nodes @ $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE CPUs/node]"
echo "======================================================"
echo ""

# Load any modules or resources here
conda activate cerberus
# source the slurm script to initialize the Ray worker nodes
source ray-slurm-cerberus.sh
# run Cerberus
cerberus.py --prodigal [input_folder] --illumina --dir_out [out_folder]

## DESeq2 and Edge2 Type I errors

Both edgeR and DeSeq2 R have the highest sensitivity when compared to other algorithms that control type-I error when the FDR was at or below 0.1. EdgeR and DESeq2 all perform fairly well in simulation and via data splitting (so no parametric assumptions). Typical benchmarks will show limma having stronger FDR control across all types of datasets (it’s hard to beat the moderated t-test), and edgeR and DESeq2 having higher sensitivity for low counts (makes sense as limma has to filter these out / down-weight them to use the normal model on log counts). Further information about type I errors are present from Mike Love's vignette here [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#multi-factor-designs)

## Contributing to Cerberus and Fungene

Cerberus as a community resource as recently acquired [FunGene](http://fungene.cme.msu.edu/), we welcome contributions of other experts expanding annotation of all domains of life (viruses, bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes).  Please send us an issue on our Cerberus GitHub [open an issue](https://github.com/raw-lab/cerberus/issues); or email us we will fully annotate your genome, add suggested pathways/metabolisms of interest, make custom HMMs to be added to Cerberus and FunGene.
